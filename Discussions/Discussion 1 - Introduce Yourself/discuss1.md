# Discussion 1 - Introduce Yourself

Hello! My name is Rodney, and I live in North County San Diego. I proudly served as a firefighter,  but after an injury, I transitioned into a technical product manager role at a medical software company.
Beyond my professional life, I'm a husband and the proud father of a 3-year-old. In my spare time, I’ve been diving into web development. I'm passionate about building an open-source web application that can make a positive impact.
I
 have some experience with web development; I've mainly been building CRUD web apps as a "for fun" hobby using Python (Flask), SQLite, MongoDB, HTML/CSS, and occasionally JavaScript. I'm most comfortable using Python, but I've wanted to return to JavaScript and re-learn the essentials.
I’m looking forward to meeting all of you.
