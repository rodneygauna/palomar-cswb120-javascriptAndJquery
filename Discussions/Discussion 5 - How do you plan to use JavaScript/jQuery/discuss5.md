# Discussion 5 - How do you plan to use JavaScript/jQuery?

In my class introduction, I talked about how I've been working on building web apps with Python, Flask, SQL Alchemy, and a few other Python libraries. In these web apps, I've only used JavaScript when necessary. For example, I've used ChartJS (<https://www.chartjs.org/>

Links to an external site.) to create graphs on a Dashboard page. ChartJS is a JavaScript library and uses JSON to parse the data I push from Python to the page. I then use JavaScript to transverse through the JSON I passed, call the ChartJS library, and populate the graph on the page. The library is accessible and flexible, but I know I can make better charts if I practice my JavaScript more.

That exposure led me to want to take a different approach; instead of having Python do all the application work, I could use it simply for the back-end code and have JavaScript take the work of the front end. In my latest application, I started to use JavaScript more for the GET, POST, etc., calls to my Python back-end. I've noticed some performance increases and troubleshooting errors is more straightforward when I know if the source is the JS or Python portion of the code.

I love Python; it's the first programming language that made coding click in my brain. Moving away from Python will be challenging, but I'd like to try moving to NodeJS-based projects. The last three companies I've worked at JavaScript shops that use NodeJS heavily. If I wanted to transition into a software developer role, I'd have more luck with a strong knowledge of JavaScript than just Python.

Once I feel more comfortable (hopefully by the end of this course), I'd like to start that transition down NodeJS.
