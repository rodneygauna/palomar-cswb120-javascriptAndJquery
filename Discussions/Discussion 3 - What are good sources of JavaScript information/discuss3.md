# Discussion 3 - What are good sources of JavaScript information?

One of my many go-to sites for JavaScript information is the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN): <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript>

Links to an external site.

MDN is an online resource that provides information and documentation for web developers. It covers various topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web APIs. For beginner programmers, MDN is helpful for several reasons:

    High-quality documentation: the documentation is well-structured and detailed.
    Tutorials and guides: MDN provides step-by-step tutorials and guides for the various topics it offers.
    Interactive examples: Many of MDN's articles include interactive code examples, allowing us to experiment with code on the page. This hands-on approach helps to reinforce learning and experimentation.
    Browser compatibility information: MDN also provides information on browser compatibility, which is crucial for creating websites that work across different browsers and versions.

MDN is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to dive deeper in to JavaScript.
