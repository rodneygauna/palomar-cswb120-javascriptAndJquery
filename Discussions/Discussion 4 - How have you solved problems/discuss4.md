# Discussion 4 - How have you solved problems?

There are a couple ways that I try solve my JavaScript programming problems.
The first thing I try to do is to break the problem down into smaller pieces. I will then try to solve each piece individually.
The second thing I try to do is to use the console to see what is happening. I will use console.log() a lot to try to figure out what is happening.
The third thing I try to do is to use the debugger to see what is happening. Seeing the steps the script is taking helps me to figure out if the order of the steps is correct or if I am missing a step.
Lastly, if I'm really stuck on a problem and don't feel like I'm making any progress, I'll using an AI Chatbot to help me thing of a different approach. Usually this helps me to think of a different way to solve the problem but in some cases, it could lead me down a rabbit hole, so I have to be careful with this approach.

As a bonus, I use the class' Discord server that Michael C. created. I'll post my question or problem to the group and get feedback pretty quickly.
Here is a link to the Discord server: <https://discord.gg/wc2EfXBwt>

I can be stubborn about trying to solve my own problems, but I'm "getting over myself" by reaching out to others sooner for help. The "1 hour rule" Professor Perry puts as a foot note for each assignment is a great guideline that's been helpful.
